# Topic Modelling in Tamil

This project is a topic modeling pipeline that uses c-TF-IDF to extract candidate topics from a corpus of documents, and then applies a custom part-of-speech tagging to identify noun phrases and generate a final list of topics. The pipeline is implemented in Python and uses the Stanza library for Tamil language processing.

While the pipeline can be applied to any language, it is especially useful for languages such as Tamil, which are underrepresented in the topic modeling literature. BERTopic, a popular Python library for topic modeling, has not yet been trained on Tamil, making it difficult to apply to Tamil-language corpora. This pipeline addresses this gap by providing a customizable, language-agnostic topic modeling pipeline that can be adapted to any language.

In summary, this project provides a powerful tool for topic modeling in languages such as Tamil, where existing topic modeling libraries may not be suitable. With its customizable architecture and support for Stanza's Tamil language processing, this pipeline is well-suited for a variety of applications in natural language processing and computational linguistics.
