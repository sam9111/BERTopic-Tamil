# Topic Modelling in Tamil

This is a project that leverages c-TF-IDF and BERTopic to perform topic modeling on a corpus of Tamil documents. The project uses custom preprocessing techniques for Tamil text, as well as a custom POS tagger based on the Stanza library.

While BERTopic does not natively support Tamil language, the project uses pre-trained Tamil models from LabSE to create appropriate embeddings.

The project provides a workflow for processing Tamil text data and creating meaningful clusters of topics that can be used for further analysis. However, it also highlights the challenges of working with a less-resourced language like Tamil and the limitations of existing NLP packages in handling such languages.
